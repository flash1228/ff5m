    Declarative updates use the existing page tree's damage and modal rules.
    A modal layer defers background-only paints. Retained foreground painters
    can open and update over existing pixels; resized panels, page replacement
    and output recovery restore the composition. Closing a layer uses current
    data without keeping a second queue of background invalidations.
    An imperative page may submit a delta through the renderer. Such a delta
    is accepted only when the content explicitly allows deltas and there are
    no active layers; otherwise it requests a tree repaint subject to the
    same modal admission rule.
    This adapter lets products migrate their page bodies independently.

    The content is a node or a declarative page. A page keeps its values in
    its own state: the product writes them there and paints, and a delta
    draws the page's changes while no layer is visible. Under a modal layer
    the changes wait for the layer to close; under other layers the
    composition repaints. update() writes the values the content node and
    the layers read.

    select_content, when given, returns (content, title, back) for the
    product's current state; each paint shows what it returns.
    write_content, when given, writes the content's values; each paint runs
    it inside its transaction, before the page's pass. A frame loop may take
    the screen's tree between transactions on its own thread, so the tree and
    its state change only there: invalidate() waits for the next paint too.

    The root draws through its ScreenFrames (_paint_screen): the engine
    composes the content and the layers by its layer rule and says what the
    next frame draws. A page's nodes are the screen tree's, the content's and
    a layer's (its _LayerSlot); every other node is recorded: the frame places the output its source last drew, which an
    imperative surface's painter draws and any other node's own tree draws
    (_record), on the reactor until such nodes are native. The renderer's
    footer is a persisting layer of that tree, between the content and the
    layers, while it shows and its strip lies in the screen; the content is
    then sized above it.
