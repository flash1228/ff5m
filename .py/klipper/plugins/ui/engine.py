"""The native node engine that every framework node is built on.

``feather_engine`` owns each node's parent, dirty level, layout revision,
flags and layout options, the layout's geometry values, and each page's
retained geometry, action table, state values and dependency index. It
arranges and renders the node tree, calling the hooks Python classes
override, draws the renderer's primitives, measures text in the font faces
and writes Typer commands. The framework has no Python implementation of
them, so it cannot start without a matching engine.
