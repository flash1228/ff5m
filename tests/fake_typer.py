"""Reads the draw FIFO, logs each flushed transaction's commands and answers
its receipt at once, as Typer publishing without deferred presentation does.
A binary command is logged as {"command": ..., "payload": hex}; every entry
carries the launch's pid. Launches are counted by the log; the config file's {"launches": [behaviour,
...]} picks each launch's behaviour (the last repeats), where exit_at is the
flush (from 1) after which it exits without an answer, as a crashing Typer.

Usage: fake_typer.py CONFIG LOG --event-pipe EVENTS batch --pipe DRAW
